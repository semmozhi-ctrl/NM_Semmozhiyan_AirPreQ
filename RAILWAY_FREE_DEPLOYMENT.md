## Project Structure for Railway

Your current structure is perfect:
```
airpreq/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Main Flask app
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile           # Process configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime.txt        # Python version
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/         # HTML templates
â”œâ”€â”€ static/           # CSS, JS, images
â””â”€â”€ modules/          # Python modules
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
1. **Check requirements.txt**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure all dependencies are listed
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Python version**:
   ```bash
   # Update runtime.txt
   echo "python-3.11.0" > runtime.txt
   ```

3. **Port configuration**:
   ```python
   # In app.py, use PORT environment variable
   import os
   port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
   app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
   ```

### Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Restart service
railway restart

# Check variables
railway variables
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Optimize your app for limited memory
# Use gunicorn with fewer workers
gunicorn --workers 1 --threads 2 app:app
```

## Monitoring Your Usage

1. **Dashboard**: Check credit usage at railway.app
2. **Alerts**: Set up usage alerts
